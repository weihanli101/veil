# Veil
#### Winning Andriod application for 2018 Guelph Hacks: Improving Life Challenge <br/>
**Best Use of RightMesh API Award** 

## Project Intent
Veil was made to solve the problem of providing health care information for inviduals or
populations with poor internet access. We did this by using the [RightMesh's](https://developer.rightmesh.io/api/) API to
allow P2P data transfer.


## How it Works
Using the RightMesh API we instantiate
d the transfer of EMR (Electronic Medical Records) through Bluetooth as a proof of concept. Two separate accounts are made. One given a paramedic role which polls for patients and the second being a patient role with sends out information. The aims is that the paramedic can review a patients EMR while travelling and then can provide immediate triage. In the future we hope to add a hospital role which will allow medical information to be stored on a person’s phone (when the person is visiting the hospital) then transferred to others through P2P (when the person returns to their limited internet access area).
